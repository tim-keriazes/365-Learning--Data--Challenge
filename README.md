# About the project <a name="project_desc"></a>

## 365 Data Science Student Engagement - Predicting Whether a Student Will Convert to Paid Account Using Machine Learning

{365 Data Science is an online learning platform specializing in data science courses. Students learn by watching video content, then evaluate their knowledge by taking quizzes, practice exams, course exams, and career track exams. The exams can be attempted more than once.

my task is to analyze a database, which shows student engagement with the 365 platform, and identify key areas of improvement. Keeping in mind the metrics that 365â€™s CEO might find useful, build a single-page dashboard or machine learning model. Share your findings with the community, uncover valuable insights, and gain meaningful experience working on a real-life database.}

# About the data

{Our data is sourced from 365 Data Science. 11 CSV Files}

## Scope

The dataset includes #### observations. #### of which contain nulls and 
#### of which are duplicates.

#### observations remain after cleaning

## Acquiring

{data sets were pulled as .csv files from 365 Data Science https://learn.365datascience.com/projects/ }

## Preparing

{The acquired data was in relatively good condition. We checked for nulls, reformatted the features to be more python friendly, and found a decent portion of duplicate data that we had to remove}
